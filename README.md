# NinjaWorks Plugin
This is the official plugin for the Ninja_Works server!
It is going to contain a simple anticheat, some player greeting messages and a bit more.
Releases are under the "Releases" tab.
As for a quick tutorial, just go under the "Releases" (or tags, depending on how you look at it) tab, then find the latest release (or any other one that you want, if it's there). Then, under "Assets", click "[Release State/Version]__[MC Version]-[Release Date].jar". It will then download the jar file, and you can rename it to something like "NinjaWorksPlugin__[ReleaseState/Version]-[MC Version].jar". Drag it under the "plugins" folder in your server files (YOU NEED THE BUCKET SERVER FILE INSTEAD OF THE DEFAULT MINECRAFT ONE) and start your server! If you did it right, somewhere during the startup process it should say "Ninja__Works plugin started!".
Enjoy!
